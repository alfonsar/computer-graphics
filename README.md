#Assignment 1: Height Map Due October 4th 
## For my input image and for recording purposes, I used an image of Barack Obama.
I decided to first show off the three types of polygon renderings: Wireframe, Triangles (Fill), and Points.
From the 3 polygon modes, I like points the best as it looks the most creative. In order to switch between these features
I used the keyboard buttons. The 'z' key is wireframe, the 'x' key is points, and the 'c' key is triangles (fill). When the program starts, it is 
set to rotation by default. In order to switch to scale, you press the 's' key. In order to switch to translate, you press the 't' key. And to rotate, you
press the 'r' key. For the first vertice I color it white and for the second vertice I color it according to the z index.
